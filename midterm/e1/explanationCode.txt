The C++ file will be compiled by the g++ compiler. If not installed on system it will be installed on the e2_testsuite


We have 3 examples in src. X should fail returning a non-zero exit code but other 2 should pass.

The exit code of the bash script should be 0 if compilation failure occurs. 

Otherwise if no file can compile we don't even get an exit code so hence the compilation failure will occur.
I assume the user can install a g++ compiler onto their machine.
