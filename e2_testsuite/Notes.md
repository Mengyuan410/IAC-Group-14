To execute the given file run chmou+x...

For this test case I decided to store the files in my own folder called my_test. I just decided to store them there because if the files were stored inside rt1 it could cause much confusion. If we nickname a directory called "my_test" it should be permitted given David Thomas nickname conventions and I can just create a directory in the exam. 

So essentially we need to compile the my_e2teststone which contains the brains of the programme. Running the e2.testsuite.sh by the ./ command just executes the my_e2teststone
a given number of times depending on how many test cases there are in total.
